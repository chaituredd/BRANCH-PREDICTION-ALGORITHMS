# BRANCH-PREDICTION-ALGORITHMS
Branch Prediction algorithms and analyze their effectiveness on real-world program traces.
following algorithms were implemented:
1)Static ALWAYS TAKEN Branch Predictor (Static-T)
2)Static ALWAYS NOT TAKEN Branch Predictor (Static-NT)
3)Dynamic BIMODAL Branch Predictor (Dynamic-BM)
4)Dynamic BIMODAL Branch Predictor with Global Branch History (Dynamic-GSHARE)
