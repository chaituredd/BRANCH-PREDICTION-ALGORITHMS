# BRANCH-PREDICTION-ALGORITHMS
Branch Prediction algorithms and analyze their effectiveness on real-world program traces.
following algorithms were implemented:
=>Static ALWAYS TAKEN Branch Predictor (Static-T) 

=>Static ALWAYS NOT TAKEN Branch Predictor (Static-NT)

=>Dynamic BIMODAL Branch Predictor (Dynamic-BM)

=>Dynamic BIMODAL Branch Predictor

=>Global Branch History (Dynamic-GSHARE)

Here i implemented the 1 and 2 in .py using spyder(anaconda) compiler
