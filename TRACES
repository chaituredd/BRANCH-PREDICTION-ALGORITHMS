The traces are generated from runs of real-world programs.
They only contain the 
dynamic instances of conditional branches alone. As unconditional branches are always taken, they are 
excluded from the trace. Each line of the trace file has two fields. Below are the first four lines of a trace 
file:
0x40fc96 1
0x40fc96 0
0x40fcb9 0
0x40fcf2 1
0x40fcf2 1
The first field is the address of the branch instruction. The second field is “1” if the branch was taken 
during the execution, or "0" for branch not being taken.
